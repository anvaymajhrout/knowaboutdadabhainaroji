                <h1>Dadabhai Naoroji</h1>
                <p>Dadabhai Naoroji (4 September 1825 â€“ 30 June 1917) was an Indian political leader, merchant, scholar, and writer who is widely regarded as the "Grand Old Man of India". He was a Liberal Party Member of Parliament (MP) in the United Kingdom House of Commons between 1892 and 1895 and the first Asian to be a British MP.</p>
                <p>Naoroji was a staunch advocate for Indian self-rule and a key figure in the early Indian National Congress, which was founded in 1885. His works and efforts in the British Parliament were instrumental in bringing the plight of India under British rule to the forefront of international attention.</p>
                <p>He is also known for his work on economic theories, particularly the "Drain Theory," which postulated that Britain was draining India's wealth to the detriment of the Indian economy. Naoroji also served as a professor of mathematics and natural philosophy at Elphinstone College in Bombay and was instrumental in the establishment of several educational institutions.</p>
